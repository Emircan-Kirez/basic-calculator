# basic-calculator
* To understand factory and strategy design patterns, I created a simple REST API calculator. 
* The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* You can send your requests by using this swagger link: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## Calculation Request Format
```json
{
  "firstOperand": 10,
  "secondOperand": 5,
  "operator": "+"
}
```

* For any question, please feel free to contact me via emircankirezz@gmail.com.
